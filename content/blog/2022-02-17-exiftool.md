## Why Strip Metadata?

Okay, so you want to strip metadata from your photos. Perhaps you take pictures
of very rare birds and the location metadata is a gold mine for poachers - or
perhaps you're just privacy-oriented like me and prefer to strip metadata from
publicly-available images.

There are various components of image metadata that you may want to delete
before releasing a photo to the public. Here's an incomplete list of things I
could easily see just by inspecting a photo on my laptop:

-   Location (Latitude & Longitude)
-   Dimensions
-   Device Make & Model
-   Color Space
-   Color Profile
-   Focal Length
-   Alpha Channel
-   Red Eye
-   Metering Mode
-   F Number

Regardless of your reasoning, I'm going to explain how I used the `exiftool`
package in Linux to automatically strip metadata from all images in a directory
(+ subdirectories).

## Installing `exiftool`

First things first: we need to install the tool. I'm running Debian 11 on my
server (Ubuntu will work the same), so the command is as simple as:

```bash
sudo apt install exiftool
```

There are different tools that can accomplish the same thing across
distributions, but I really only care to test out this one package.

## Recursively Strip Data

I actually use this tool extensively to strip any photos uploaded to the website
that serves all of the images for my blog (`img.cleberg.io`).

The following command is incredibly useful and can be modified to include any
image extensions that `exiftool` supports:

```bash
exiftool -r -all= -ext jpg -ext png /path/to/directory/
```

See below for the results of my most recent usage of `exiftool` after I uploaded
the image for this blog post. You can see that the command will let you know how
many directories were scanned, how many images were updated, and how many images
were unchanged.
