## My Approach to Self-Hosting Git

I have often tried to self-host my Git repositories, but have always fallen
short when I tried to find a suitable web interface to show on the front-end.

After a few years, I have finally found a combination of methods that allow me
to easily self-host my projects, view them on the web, and access them from
anywhere.

Before I dive into the details, I want to state a high-level summary of my
self-hosted Git approach:

- This method uses the `ssh://` (read & write) and `git://` (read-only)
  protocols for push and pull access.
  - For the `git://` protocol, I create a `git-daemon-export-ok` file in any
    repository that I want to be cloneable by anyone.
  - The web interface I am using (`cgit`) allows dumb HTTP cloning by default. I
    do not disable this setting as I want beginners to be able to clone one of my
    repositories even if they don't know the proper method.
- I am not enabling Smart HTTPS for any repositories. Updates to repositories
  must be pushed via SSH.
- Beyond the actual repository management, I am using `cgit` for the front-end 
  web interface.
  - If you use the `scan-path=<path>` configuration in the `cgitrc` 
  configuration file to automatically find repositories, you can't exclude" a 
  repository from `cgit` if it's stored within the path that `cgit` reads. To 
  host private repositories, you'd need to set up another directory that `cgit` 
  can't read.

## Assumptions

For the purposes of this walkthrough, I am assuming you have a URL
(`git.example.com`) or IP address (`207.84.26.991`) addressed to the server that
you will be using to host your git repositories.

## Adding a Git User

In order to use the SSH method associated with git, we will need to add a
user named `git`. If you have used the SSH method for other git hosting sites,
you are probably used to the following syntax:

```sh
git clone [user@]server:project.git
```

The syntax above is an `scp`-like syntax for using SSH on the `git` user on the
server to access your repository.

Let's delete any remnants of an old `git` user, if any, and create the new user
account:

```sh
sudo deluser --remove-home git
sudo adduser git
```

### Import Your SSH Keys to the Git User

Once the `git` user is created, you will need to copy your public SSH key on
your local development machine to the `git` user on the server.

If you don't have an SSH key yet, create one with this command:

```sh
ssh-keygen
```

Once you create the key pair, the public should be saved to `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`.

If your server still has password-based authentication available, you can copy
it over to your user's home directory like this:

```sh
ssh-copy-id git@server
```

Otherwise, copy it over to any user that you can access.

```sh
scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub your_user@your_server:
```

Once on the server, you will need to copy the contents into the `git` user's
`authorized_keys` file:

```sh
cat id_rsa.pub > /home/git/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

### (Optional) Disable Password-Based SSH

If you want to lock-down your server and ensure that no one can authenticate in
via SSH with a password, you will need to edit your SSH configuration.

```sh
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Within this file, find the following settings and set them to the values I am
showing below:

```conf
PermitRootLogin no
PasswordAuthentication no
AuthenticationMethods publickey
```

You may have other Authentication Methods required in your personal set-up, so
the key here is just to ensure that `AuthenticationMethods` does not allow
passwords.

## Setting up the Base Directory

Now that we have set-up a `git` user to handle all of transport methods, we need
to set-up the directory that we will be using as our base of all repositories.

In my case, I am using `/git` as my source folder. To create this folder and
assign it to the user we created, execute the following commands:

```sh
sudo mkdir /git
sudo chown -R git:git /git
```

## Creating a Test Repository

On your server, switch over to the `git` user in order to start managing git
files.

```sh
su git
```

Once logged-in as the `git` user, go to your base directory and create a test
repository.

```sh
cd /git
mkdir test.git && cd test.git
git init --bare
```

If you want to make this repo viewable/cloneable to the public via the `git://`
protocol, you need to create a `git-daemon-export-ok` file inside the
repository.

```sh
touch git-daemon-export-ok
```

## Change the Login Shell for `git`

To make sure that the `git` user is only used for git operations and nothing 
else, you need to change the user's login shell. To do this, simply use the 
`chsh` command:

```sh
sudo chsh git
```

The interactive prompt will ask which shell you want the `git` user to use. You 
must use the following value:

```sh
/usr/bin/git-shell
```

Once done, no one will be able to SSH to the `git` user or execute commands 
other than the standard git commands.

## Opening the Firewall

Don't forget to open up ports on the device firewall and network firewall if
you want to access these repositories publicly. If you're using default ports,
forward ports `22` (ssh) and `9418` (git) from your router to your server's IP
address.

If your server also has a firewall, ensure that the firewall allows the same
ports that are forwarded from the router. For example, if you use `ufw`:

```sh
sudo ufw allow 22
sudo ufw allow 9418
```

### Non-Standard SSH Ports

If you use a non-standard port for SSH, such as `9876`, you will need to create
an SSH configuration file on your local development machine in order to connect
to your server's git repositories.

To do this, you'll need to define your custom port on your client machine in
your `~/.ssh/config` file:

```sh
nano ~/.ssh/config
```

```conf
Host git.example.com
  # HostName can be a URL or an IP address
  HostName git.example.com
  Port 9876
  User git
```

### Testing SSH

There are two main syntaxes you can use to manage git over SSH:

- `git clone [user@]server:project.git`
- `git clone ssh://[user@]server/project.git`

I prefer the first, which is an `scp`-like syntax. To test it, try to clone the
test repository you set up on the server:

```sh
git clone git@git.example.com:/git/test.git
```

## Enabling Read-Only Access

If you want people to be able to clone any repository where you've placed a
`git-daemon-export-ok` file, you will need to start the git daemon.

To do this on a system with `systemd`, create a service file:

```sh
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/git-daemon.service
```

Inside the `git-daemon.service` file, paste the following:

```conf
[Unit]
Description=Start Git Daemon

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/git daemon --reuseaddr --base-path=/git/ /git/

Restart=always
RestartSec=500ms

StandardOutput=syslog
StandardError=syslog
SyslogIdentifier=git-daemon

User=git
Group=git

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Once created, enable and start the service:

```sh
sudo systemctl enable git-daemon.service
sudo systemctl start git-daemon.service
```

To clone read-only via the `git://` protocol, you can use the following syntax:

```sh
git clone git://git.example.com/test.git
```

## Migrating Repositories

At this point, we have a working git server that works with both SSH and
read-only access.

For each of the repositories I had hosted a different provider, I executed the
following commands in order to place a copy on my server as my new source of
truth:

Server:

```sh
su git
mkdir /git/<REPOSITORY_NAME>.git && cd /git/<REPOSITORY_NAME>.git
git init --bare

# If you want to make this repo viewable/cloneable to the public
touch git-daemon-export-ok
```

Client:

```sh
git clone git@<PREVIOUS_HOST>:<REPOSITORY_NAME>
git remote set-url origin git@git.EXAMPLE.COM:/git/<REPOSITORY_NAME>.git
git push
```

## Optional Web View: `cgit`

If you want a web viewer for your repositories, you can use various tools, such
as `gitweb`, `cgit`, or `klaus`. I chose `cgit` due to its simple interface and
fairly easy set-up (compared to others). Not to mention that the
[Linux kernel uses `cgit`](https://git.kernel.org/).

### Docker Compose

Instead of using my previous method of using a `docker run` command, I've 
updated this section to use `docker-compose` instead for an easier installation 
and simpler management and configuration.

In order to use Docker Compose, you will set up a `docker-compose.yml` file to 
automatically connect resources like the repositories, `cgitrc`, and various 
files or folders to the `cgit` container you're creating:

```sh
mkdir ~/cgit && cd ~/cgit
nano docker-compose.yml
```

```conf
# docker-compose.yml
version: '3'

services:
  cgit:
    image: invokr/cgit
    volumes:
      - /git:/git
      - ./cgitrc:/etc/cgitrc
      - ./logo.png:/var/www/htdocs/cgit/logo.png
      - ./favicon.png:/var/www/htdocs/cgit/favicon.png
      - ./filters:/var/www/htdocs/cgit/filters
    ports:
      - "8763:80"
    restart: always
```

Then, just start the container:

```sh
sudo docker-compose up -d
```

Once it's finished installing, you can access the site at `<SERVER_IP>:8763` or
use a reverse-proxy service to forward `cgit` to a URL, such as
`git.example.com`. See the next section for more details on reverse proxying a
URL to a local port.

### Nginx Reverse Proxy

I am using Nginx as my reverse proxy so that the `cgit` Docker container can use
`git.cleberg.net` as its URL. To do so, I simply created the following
configuration file:

```sh
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/git.example.com
```

```conf
server {
        listen 80;
	      server_name git.example.com;

      	if ($host = git.example.com) {
		        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
	      }

    	  return 404;
}

server {
        server_name git.example.com;
        listen 443 ssl http2;

        location / {
                # The final `/` is important.
		            proxy_pass http://localhost:8763/;
                add_header X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN;
                add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block";
                proxy_redirect off;
                proxy_buffering off;
                proxy_set_header Host $host;
                proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
                proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
                proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
                proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Port $server_port;
        }

        # INCLUDE ANY SSL CERTS HERE
        include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf;
        ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem;
}

```

Once created, symlink it and restart the web server.

```sh
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/git.example.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo systemctl restart nginx.service
```

As we can see below, my site at `git.cleberg.net` is available and running:

![cgit example](https://img.cleberg.net/blog/20220701-git-server/cgit.png)

### Settings Up Git Details

Once you have `cgit` running, you can add some small details, such as repository
owners and descriptions by editing the following files within each repository.

Alternatively, you can use the `cgitrc` file to edit these details if you only 
care to edit them for the purpose of seeing them on your website.

The `description` file within the repository on your server will display the
description online.

```sh
cd /git/example.git
nano description
```

You can add a `[gitweb]` block to the `config` file in order to display the
owner of the repository.

```sh
cd /git/example.git
nano config
```

```conf
[gitweb]
	owner = "YourName"
```

Note that you can ignore the configuration within each repository and simply set 
up this information in the `cgitrc` file, if you want to do it that way.

### Editing `cgit`

In order to edit certain items within `cgit`, you need to edit the `cgitrc` 
file. 

```sh
nano ~/cgit/cgitrc
```

Below is an example configuration for `cgitrc`. You can find all of the
configuration options within the
[configuration manual](https://git.zx2c4.com/cgit/plain/cgitrc.5.txt).

```conf
css=/cgit.css
logo=/logo.png
favicon=/favicon.png
robots=noindex, nofollow

enable-blame=1
enable-log-filecount=1

### Final Fixes: Syntax Highlighting & README Rendering

After completing my initial install and playing around with it for a few days, I 
noticed two issues:

1. Syntax highlighting did not work when viewing the source code within a file.
2. The `about` tab within a repository was not rendered to HTML.

The following process fixes these issues. To start, lets go to the `cgit` 
directory where we were editing our configuration file earlier.

```sh
cd ~/cgit
```

In here, create two folders that will hold our syntax files:

```sh
mkdir filters && mkdir filters/html-converters && cd filters
```

Next, download the default filters:

```sh
curl https://git.zx2c4.com/cgit/plain/filters/about-formatting.sh > about-formatting.sh
chmod 755 about-formatting.sh
curl https://git.zx2c4.com/cgit/plain/filters/syntax-highlighting.py > syntax-highlighting.py
chmod 755 syntax-highlighting.py
```

Finally, download the HTML conversion files you need. The example below just 
downloads the Markdown converter:

```sh
cd html-converters
curl https://git.zx2c4.com/cgit/plain/filters/html-converters/md2html > md2html
chmod 755 md2html
```

If you need other filters or html-converters found within [the cgit project 
files](https://git.zx2c4.com/cgit/tree/filters), repeat the `curl` and `chmod` 
process above for whichever files you need.

However, formatting will not work quite yet since the Docker cgit container 
we're using doesn't have the formatting package installed. You can install this 
easily by install Python 3+ and the `pygments` package:

```sh
# Enter the container's command line
sudo docker exec -it cgit bash
```

```sh
# Install the necessary packages and then exit
yum update -y &&                      \
yum upgrade -y &&                     \
yum install python3 python3-pip -y && \
pip3 install markdown pygments &&     \
exit
```

**You will need to enter the cgit docker container and re-run these `yum` 
commands every time you kill and restart the container!**

If not done already, we need to add the following variables to our 
`cgitrc` file in order for `cgit` to know where our filtering files are:

```conf
# Highlight source code with python pygments-based highlighter
source-filter=/var/www/htdocs/cgit/filters/syntax-highlighting.py

# Format markdown, restructuredtext, manpages, text files, and html files
# through the right converters
about-filter=/var/www/htdocs/cgit/filters/about-formatting.sh
```

Now you should see that syntax highlighting and README rendering to the `about` 
tab is fixed. See the images below for illustrations:

### Theming

I won't go into much detail in this section, but you can fully theme your 
installation of `cgit` since you have access to the `cgit.css` file in your web 
root. This is another file you can add as a volume to the `docker-compose.yml` 
file if you want to edit this without entering the container's command line.

For example, I created a Stylus theme called 
[dark-cgit](https://git.sr.ht/~cmc/dark-cgit) to use for my 
personal website. This theme just needs the URL updated to work for any other 
cgit-based site. Here's what this theme looks like in action:

Index:
![dark-cgit home](https://img.cleberg.net/blog/20220701-git-server/dark-cgit-home.png)

Syntax Highlighting:
![dark-cgit code](https://img.cleberg.net/blog/20220701-git-server/dark-cgit-code.png)

README Rendering:

## :warning: Remember to Backup Your Data!

The last thing to note is that running services on your own equipment means that
you're assuming a level of risk that exists regarding data loss, catastrophes,
etc. In order to reduce the impact of any such occurrence, I suggest backing up
your data regularly.

Backups can be automated via `cron`, by hooking your base directory up to a
cloud provider, or even setting up hooks to push all repository info to git
mirrors on other git hosts. Whatever the method, make sure that your data
doesn't vanish in the event that your drives or servers fail.
