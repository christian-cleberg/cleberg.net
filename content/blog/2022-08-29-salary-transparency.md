## My Personal Salary Transparency

In an effort to not bury the lede, I want to start by noting that my personal 
salary history is now [publicly available on this site](/salary/).

I have made this step in an effort to help lead the way among those who wish to 
share, compare, or research salaries in my field. I feel that this is a 
necessary step in order to de-mystify the compensation culture in the US 
workplace.

### Why?

Over the years, I have faced situations that would have been alleviated by pay 
transparency:

- Co-workers being paid significantly less/more while holding similar 
education, certifications, and skills.
  - Some of these included people in the same demographics as myself and some 
  other situations included people of different ages, genders, etc.
- Potential applicants not understanding pay scales for certain roles or 
industries.
- Interviewers not disclosing salary until the end of the interview process.
- Colleagues not understanding how certain degrees, certifications, or 
accomplishments on the job can affect salary and/or bonuses.
- Employers hiding their decisions on raises/promotions and vaguely 
referencing "market value" without any further comment.
- Interns and/or staff without enough career knowledge to even know where to 
begin due to compensation being a "taboo" topic.

While discussing my thoughts and sharing facts and data with those I have 
encountered during these situations, my experience is a single data point in a 
sea of employees.

Equitable compensation will only continue to occur if we all shake off the 
awkwardness of discussing salaries and be honest about our experiences.

### Why Now?

For years, I have been thinking about ways to publish my salary data 
transparently online but I never landed on a good format or delivery method. 
After stumbling on [Xe's salary 
transparency](https://xeiaso.net/salary-transparency) page, I decided to simply 
mimic that approach for now.

I may alter my design in the future and include more details or visualizations 
reflecting cost of living, but I like the way it sits right now.
