## Currently

It's currently about 11:30 PM here and thunderstorms are rolling through the
area, which means it's the perfect time to settle down, put my headphones in,
and write a blog post.

## Programming

While I haven't been able to blog or write a lot of code lately, I did submit a
couple pull requests to get `cleberg.net` listed on the
[512KB Club](https://512kb.club/) and [1MB Club](https://1mb.club/) websites,
which are dedicated to performance-based websites that fit their size limits.
Since `cleberg.net` currently measures around `30.0KB` (`22.6KB` is the
`favicon.ico`), I'm hoping the PRs will be approved soon.

~~There's also a list out there dedicated to websites that do not include JS,
but I believe it required submitting a request via Sourcehut, so I'm not sure if
it's worth the hassle.~~

After a little further looking, I also went ahead and submitted PRs to the
[250KB Club](https://250kb.club/) and [no-JS Club](https://no-js.club/)
listings.

## Estoy Aprendiendo Espa√±ol

In other news, I have decided to take another crack at learning Spanish. I took
a Spanish 101 course in college before I switched my major from Chemistry to
Accounting, which didn't have a language requirement.

However, I enjoyed learning Spanish immensely and was quite good at the topics
we covered that semester. Given that I have a few friends and family members who
speak it, I want to give it another chance and see if I can master enough to
write blog posts, notes, or order food fully in Spanish. To me, that would equal
success.

## Career

I am moving companies once again, this time transferring from one of the
[Big 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Four_accounting_firms) firms
([EY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_%26_Young)) to another one
([KPMG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KPMG)). I will be doing largely the same
work as a Senior IT Auditor, but I will be on a smaller team and will be
focusing on a different geographical region than I have been for the last year
with EY. This switch is a great opportunity and I'm looking forward to the
different opportunities and challenges it may hold for me.

## Personal Life

Personally, I've been dedicating time recently to my physical well-being. I've
invested in some home exercise equipment, which helps with my tremendously lazy
habit of avoiding driving to a local gym. Having an indoor bicycle and dumbbells
sitting nearby makes everything so much easier and I can already tell that it's
paying off.

Likewise, I've also started disc golfing. I have been disc golfing maybe ten
times in my life prior to this year, mostly when family members drag me out to a
course during a vacation, but I decided to take it up more seriously since it's
hard to find an open/convenient basketball court (my preferred sport) to play on
where I currently live.

So far, I've only been able to disc golf a handful of times in the last month or
two. However, it's been fun and it's a nice way to spend an hour or two outdoors
on the weekends.
