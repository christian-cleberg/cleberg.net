* Org-Mode

I'm trying out [[https://orgmode.org/][orgmode]] for the first time to see if it has what I need
for blogging and note taking.

So far, it feels /great/. It's taking a while to get used to the
syntax due to sheer volume of things you can with it. However, I will
note that I like having a single source of truth regarding syntax. I
have historically used Markdown and dislike having to research whether
my tools are using Markdown, Github Flavored Markdown, CommonMark,
etc.

** Syntax Examples

Text:

*bold*, /italics/, _underline_, =verbatim=, ~code~, +strikethrough+

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
To be or not to be...
#+END_QUOTE

For example, here's a code block using the =shell= language:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
doas apk add libsodium
#+END_SRC

Here's a table:

| A     | B      | C       |
|-------+--------+---------|
| apple | banana | coconut |

Lists:

1. One
2. Two
   - Three
   * Four

TODO:

*** TODO List
   - [-] one
   - [ ] two
   - [X] three
