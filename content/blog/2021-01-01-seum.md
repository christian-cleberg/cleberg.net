## Game Description

[SEUM: Speedrunners from Hell](https://store.steampowered.com/app/457210/SEUM_Speedrunners_from_Hell/)
is an incredibly fast-paced mashup of a puzzle game and a free-running game.
Created by [Pine Studio](https://pinestudio.co) in early 2016 and first released
as a
[demo on GameJolt](https://gamejolt.com/games/seum-speedrunners-from-hell-demo/154868),
this game was successfully greenlit on Steam and has amassed a cult following on
multiple consoles.

Here's the game description straight from the developers:

> Like a bastard child of Quake 3 and Super Meat Boy, SEUM: Speedrunners from
> Hell is truly hardcore and focuses on speed and fast reaction.

## Story

SEUM does a great job setting the stage when you open the game for the first
time, playing an animated video in the form of comic book images. You see Marty,
the protagonist, sitting around drinking his beer as Satan busts down the door,
cuts his hand off, and steals all his beer and bacon. As Satan is leaving, Marty
whips a vinyl record across the room and cuts off one of Satan's hands. This
hand is what allows you to use all the powers in the game.

Check out the screenshot below for one of the first panels of the storyline:

## Gameplay

To accomplish each level, you will need to get to final blue portal under a
certain time limit. You can beat a level by getting to the portal before the
time meter runs out or "Dominate" a level by beating it within a shorter time
limit (noted by a bright red/orange color in the time meter).

The portal is usually set behind locked gates, protected by dangerous defenses,
or in hard-to-reach places. To reach the portal, you'll need to go through any
existing orange portals, light all yellow beacons, avoid things like fireballs
and blades, or use any satanic power orbs lying around. These special abilities
include:

-   Gravity
-   Teleport
-   Rewind
-   Spawn platform
-   Roar (DLC)
-   Rocket (DLC)
-   Shadow world (DLC)

For the main storyline, there are nine floors to beat. Each floor contains nine
regular levels, one boss level, and one bonus level - although you don't
technically need to beat all levels to advance to the next floor.

## In-Game Screenshots

The main menu gives you plenty of options for tuning your system, playing main
levels, playing the DLC, or exploring the other game modes.

Once you enter a level, you can look around and strategize before starting.
Clicking any button will start the menu, and you'll have to restart if you die.
One of the great things about SEUM is that it has great keyboard shortcuts. You
can quickly smash `R` to restart the level or `M` to return to level menu.

Once you're able to win a level, you'll see the high scores and can watch
replays of the best scores.

Each regular level contains a beer in a disguised location that may take some
out-of-the-box thinking.
