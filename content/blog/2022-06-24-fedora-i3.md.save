## Leaving macOS

As I noted [in a recent post](/blog/foss-macos-apps), I have been planning on 
migrating from macOS back to GNU/Linux. I am happy to say that I have finally 
completed my migration and am now stuck in the wonderful world of Linux again.

My decision to leave macOS really came down to just a few, important things:

- Apple Security (Gatekeeper) restricting me from running any software I want. 
Even if you disable Gatekeeper and allow a software to bypass the rest of the 
device installation security, you still have to repeat that process every time 
the allowed software is updated.
- macOS sends out nearly constant connections, pings, telemetry, etc. to a 
myriad of mysterious Apple services. I'm not even going to dive into how many 
macOS apps have constant telemetry on, as well.
- Lastly, I just *really* missed the customization and freedom that comes with 
Linux. Being able to switch to entirely new kernel, OS, or desktop within 
minutes is a freedom I took for granted when I switched to macOS.

Now that I've covered macOS, I'm going to move on to more exciting topics: my 
personal choice of OS, DE, and various customizations I'm using.

## Fedora

After trying a ton of distros (I think I booted and tested around 20-25 
distros), I finally landed on [Fedora Linux](https://getfedora.org/). I have 
quite a bit of experience with Fedora and enjoy the `dnf` package manager. 
Fedora allows me to keep up-to-date with recent software (I'm looking at you, 
Debian), but still provides a level of stability you don't find in every distro.

In a very close second place was Arch Linux, as well as its spinoff: Garuda 
Linux (Garuda w/ sway is *beautiful*). Arch is great for compatibility and the 
massive community it has, but I have just never had the time to properly sit 
down and learn the methodology behind their packaging systems.

Basically everything else I tested was unacceptable in at least one way or 
another. Void (`glibc`) was great, but doesn't support all of the software I 
need. Slackware worked well as a tui, but I wasn't skilled enough to get a 
tiling window manager (WM) working on it.

### i3

![i3wm]()

One of the reasons I settled on Fedora is that it comes with an official i3 
spin. Being able to use a tiling WM, such as i3 or sway, is one of the biggest 
things I wanted to do as soon as I adopted Linux again.

I will probably set-up a dotfile repository soon, so that I don't lose any of my 
configurations, but for now you are stuck just reading this blog post to see 
what I've changed in order to get the result in the screenshot above.
