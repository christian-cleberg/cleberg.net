## Perfect is the Enemy of Good

As the saying goes, "the best is the enemy of the good." As we strive for perfection, we often fail to realize the
implications of such an undertaking. Attempting to reach perfection is often unrealistic and even worse, it can get in
the way of achieving a good outcome. In certain situations, we try so hard to achieve the ideal solution that we have
burned the bridges that would have allowed us to reach a lesser yet still superb solution.

Philosophers throughout history have inspected this plight from many viewpoints. Greek mythology speaks of
the [golden mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_mean_(philosophy)), which uses the story of Icarus to illustrate
that sometimes "the middle course" is the best solution. In this story, Daedalus, a famous artist of his time, built
feathered wings for himself and his son so that they might escape the clutches of King Minos. Daedalus warns his beloved
son whom he loved so much to "fly the middle course", between the sea spray and the sun's heat. Icarus did not heed his
father; he flew up and up until the sun melted the wax off his wings. For not heeding the middle course, he fell into
the sea and drowned.

More recently, management scholars have explored the [Pareto principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle)
and found that as we increase the frequency of something, or strive to perform actions to achieve some form of
perfection, we run into [diminishing returns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminishing_returns).

Even further, Harold Demsetz is noted as coining the
term [the Nirvana fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_fallacy) in 1969, which shows the fallacy of comparing
actual things with unrealistic, idealized alternatives. This is another trap that we may fall into, where we are
constantly thinking of the ultimate solutions to problems, when something more realistic needs to be considered.

Over and over throughout history, we've found that perfection is often unrealistic and unachievable. However, we push
ourselves, and our peers to "give 100%" or "go the extra mile", while it may be that the better course is to give a
valuable level of effort while considering the effects of further effort on the outcome. Working harder does not always
help us achieve loftier goals.

This has presented itself to me most recently during my time studying at my university. I was anxious and feeling the
stresses of my courses, career, and personal life for quite a while, which was greatly affecting how well I was doing at
school and my level of effort at work. One day, I happened to be talking to my father when he said something simple that
hit home:

> All you can do is show up and do your best. Worrying about the outcomes won't affect the outcome itself.

The thought was extremely straightforward and uncomplicated, yet it was something that I had lost sight of during my
stress-filled years at school. Ever since then, I've found myself pausing and remembering that quote every time I get
anxious or stressed. It helps to stop and think "Can I do anything to affect the outcome or am I simply worrying over
something I can't change?"

## When Mediocrity Isn't Enough

One problem with the philosophies presented in this post is that they are implemented far too often in situations where
mediocrity simply isn't adequate. For example, let's take a look at digital user data, specifically
personally-identifiable information (PII). As a cybersecurity auditor in the United States, I have found that most
companies are concerned more with compliance than any actual safeguards over the privacy or protection of user data.
Other than companies who have built their reputation on privacy and security, most companies will
use [satisficing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisficing) as their primary decision-making strategy around user data.

> Satisficing is a decision-making strategy or cognitive heuristic that entails searching through the available alternatives until an acceptability threshold is met.

This means that each decision will be met with certain possible solutions until one of the solutions meets their minimum
acceptable standards. For companies that deal with user data, the minimum acceptable standards come from three areas:

1. Laws and regulations
2. Competitive pressure
3. Risk of monetary or reputation loss

Working with project management or auditing, the primary concern here is the risk of legal ramifications. Since the
primary risk comes from laws and regulations, companies will require that any project that involves user data must
follow all the rules of those laws so that the company can protect itself from fines or other penalties. Following this,
companies will consider best practices in order to place itself in a competitive position (e.g. Google vs. Apple) and
review any recent or ongoing litigation against companies regarding user data. In a perfect company, management would
then consider the ethical responsibilities of their organization and discuss their responsibilities over things like
personally-identifiable information. However, as we mentioned above, most companies follow the idea of satisficing,
which states that they have met the minimum acceptable standards and can now move on to other decisions. Modern business
culture in the United States dictates that profits are the golden measure of how well a company or manager is
performing, so we often don't think about our responsibilities beyond these basic standard.

Not all situations demand excellence, but I believe that applying any philosophy as a broad stroke across one's life can
be a mistake. We must be able to think critically about what we are doing as we do it and ask ourselves a few questions.
Have I done everything I can in this situation? Is mediocrity an acceptable outcome or should we strive for perfection,
even if we can't attain it?

Taking a few moments to think critically throughout our day, as we make decisions, can have a tremendous effect on the
outcomes we create.
