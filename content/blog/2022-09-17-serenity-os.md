## Overview

[SerenityOS](https://serenityos.org) is a unique operating system (OS) that I 
have seen pop up in my news feed a few times over the last few years, but I have 
never had time to test it out until now.

Testing out this system brough back fond memories of yellowed, 
modem-screeching, 100 lb. computers that brought so many fond memories to my 
youth.

Per their website:

> A graphical Unix-like operating system for desktop computers!
>
> SerenityOS is a love letter to '90s user interfaces with a custom Unix-like 
> core. It flatters with sincerity by stealing beautiful ideas from various 
> other systems.
>
> Roughly speaking, the goal is a marriage between the aesthetic of late-1990s 
> productivity software and the power-user accessibility of late-2000s *nix.
>
> This is a system by us, for us, based on the things we like.

## Building

Your first question may be "Where's the iso?" and the answer is... there are 
none. SerenityOS does not provide pre-built images for testing. You must build 
the images yourself. This seems intentionally to limit participation to only 
those who are truly interested enough to learn how to build the OS.

### Clone

In order to get started, you'll need to clone the source repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity && cd serenity
```

### Build

Note that I followed the [Build 
Instructions](https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity/blob/master/Documentation/BuildInstructions.md) 
in the SerenityOS repository as of commit 
`660d2b53b1206e868d5470eee80b5e62d7e30da7`. Things may have changes since my 
installation and you should double-check the instructions first.

Regardless, I want to repeat my steps here to illustrate any errors or differing 
commands I needed to run in order to build and run SerenityOS.

Since I am running Fedora, I needed to install these packages in order to build 
the OS images:

```sh
sudo dnf install texinfo binutils-devel curl cmake mpfr-devel libmpc-devel gmp-devel e2fsprogs ninja-build patch ccache rsync @"C Development Tools and Libraries" @Virtualization
```

Next, make sure you're inside the `serenity` directory created earlier 
during the git cloning process and process to build the toolchain:

```sh
Meta/serenity.sh rebuild-toolchain
```

Once the toolchain is built, you can Build and run the OS!

```sh
Meta/serenity.sh run
```

After this process is completed, the image should run automatically and launch.

## Issues

I played around in SerenityOS for an hour or two in order to see what I could do 
and had a lot of fun with it. The only issue I ran into was a lack of working 
internet. I didn't try very hard, but I could tell that the main network link 
wasn't connecting to my Fedora host properly.

## Screenshots

The initial launch of the image displays the SerenityOS desktop, with a simple 
terminal already launched:

Here you can see the Fire application (literally just shows fire burning), a 
browser with the local Serenity Browser page loaded, and a text editor.

I also poked around the system utilities and found most tools you'd expect to 
find within a standard desktop.

Lastly, I noted that the default desktop contains numerous pre-defined themes to 
choose from. This is a small piece, but it's actually wonderful to see desktop 
developers consider theming directly out of the box rather than using an 
addon-based mentality.

I didn't take a screenshot of the other pre-installed games, but I did spend 
nearly 30 minutes playing Solitaire before remembering that I was supposed to be 
writing a post about the OS.
