## Auto-Mount Steam Drives

![Steam example](https://img.cleberg.io/blog/20200125-the-best-linux-software/steam.png "Steam example")

If you want to see how to install Steam on Linux, see my other post:
[The Best Linux Software](/blog/linux-software/).

Are you having trouble launching games, even though they've installed correctly?
This may happen if you're storing your games on an NTFS-formatted drive. This
shouldn't be an issue if you're storing your games on the same drive that Steam
is on, but some gamers prefer to put Steam on their main drive and game files on
another SSD or HDD.

To fix this problem, you'll need to try a few things. First, you'll need to
install the `ntfs-3g` package, which is meant for better interoperability with
Linux.

```bash
sudo apt install ntfs-3g
```

Next, you should set up the `/etc/fstab` file to automatically mount your drives
on boot. To automatically mount your drives when the computer boots up, you'll
have to create the folders you want to mount your drive to first. I store mine
in the `/mnt` folder using names that I'll recognize, but you can create your
folders wherever you want.

```bash
mkdir /path/to/folder
```

For example:

```bash
mkdir /mnt/steam_library
```

To automatically mount drives upon system boot, you will need to collect a few
items. The UUID is the identification number connected to whichever drive you're
using to store Steam games.

Drives are usually labeled similar to `/dev/nvme0n1p1` or `/dev/sda1`, so you'll
need to find the line in the output of the command below that correlates to your
drive and copy the UUID over to the `/etc/fstab` file.

```bash
sudo blkid | grep UUID=
```

Next, you'll need your `uid` and `gid`.. To find these, run the following
command:

```bash
id -u && id -g
```

Now that you have collected the necessary information, open the `/etc/fstab`
file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/fstab
```

Each drive you want to mount on boot should have its own line in the
`/etc/fstab` file that looks similar to this:

```config
UUID=B64E53824E5339F7 /mnt/steam_library ntfs-3g uid=1000,gid=1000 0 0
```

Now all you need to do is unmount your drive and re-mount it. You can unmount
the drive by doing this (be sure to use the correct drive name here):

```bash
sudo umount /dev/sdxX
```

You can re-mount all your drives by executing the following:

```bash
sudo mount -a
```

If you don't know what your drive name is, or you're nervous about un-mounting
and re-mounting, simply reboot your computer, and it will be done for you
automatically.
