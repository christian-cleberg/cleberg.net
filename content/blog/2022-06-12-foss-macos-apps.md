## macOS & Me

I started using macOS over a year ago, as I wrote about in [macOS: Testing Out A
New OS](/blog/macos/).

Over the last year, I have tried out numerous proprietary and FOSS applications
and command-line utilities. Throughout this process, I have ended up with a
mostly-FOSS lineup of applications.

Before I switch back to Linux in a few weeks, I wanted to pause and save this
snapshot of how I was using macOS in 2022.

Read on to see the applications I regularly use, both FOSS and proprietary.

### IDE

#### VSCodium

- [Website](https://vscodium.com/)
- [Source Code](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium)

VSCodium is a slimmed-down version of Microsoft's VSCode and has all of the
telemetry removed. I enjoy using this IDE simply due to its massive number
of add-ons available.

Source Code](https://github.com/mobeigi/filebot)

renaming movies and TV shows using custom templates.

### Files & Cloud Storage

#### pCloud

- [Website](https://www.pcloud.com/)
- [Source Code](https://github.com/pcloud)

pCloud is my current cloud provider choice. I bounce around cloud providers quite a lot,
but iCloud was syncing incredibly slowly lately and caused me to migrate over to pCloud.

![pCloud](https://img.cleberg.io/blog/20220612-foss-macos-apps/pcloud.png)

#### Cryptomator

- [Website](https://cryptomator.org/)
- [Source Code](https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator)

For all files saved within a cloud provider, I suggest using Cryptomator to encrypt your
files locally before they ever touch the provider's servers. This is one of the only ways
to ensure that a third party isn't able to touch or read your personal data.

![Cryptomator](https://img.cleberg.io/blog/20220612-foss-macos-apps/cryptomator.png)

#### GPG Tools

- [Website](https://gpgtools.org/)
- [Source Code](https://releases.gpgtools.org/GPG_Suite-2022.1.txz)

GPG Tools is the easiest way I've found to manage GPG keys on macOS. This tool allows me
to painlessly encrypt emails, decrypt emails, and sign my git commits.

![GPG Tools](https://img.cleberg.io/blog/20220612-foss-macos-apps/gpg_tools.png)

#### Gramps

- [Website](https://gramps-project.org/blog/)
- [Source Code](https://github.com/gramps-project/gramps)

Gramps is a classic genealogy tool, allowing for editing, exporting, and visualization
of GEDCOM genealogy data.

### Messaging

#### Element (Matrix)

- [Website](https://element.io/)

Element is the official client for the Matrix messaging protocol. I've tried a handful of
clients and haven't found anything as good as Element yet.

![Element](https://img.cleberg.io/blog/20220612-foss-macos-apps/element.png)

#### Signal

- [Website](https://signal.org/)
- [Source Code](https://github.com/signalapp)

Signal is another self-explanatory one. This is the desktop companion app that syncs with
the mobile app.

![Signal](https://img.cleberg.io/blog/20220612-foss-macos-apps/signal.png)

### Command-Line Tools

#### amfora

#### exiftool

- [Website](https://exiftool.org/)
- [Source Code](https://github.com/exiftool/exiftool)

`exiftool` is an excellent image editing tool for the command-line. I wrote a blog
post about it recently: [Stripping Image Metadata with exiftool](/blog/exiftool/).

```

#### ffmpeg

#### yt-dlp

- [Source Code](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)

A simple command-line utility to extract audio and video files from video hosting websites.

For example, to extract a video as a `.flac` audio file:

```

## Proprietary macOS Apps

### Media

#### Meta

- [Website](https://www.nightbirdsevolve.com/meta/)

Meta is an excellent tag editor for musical files. While the base app costs $5 and the
auto-finder + image selector costs an additional $5, this tool is excellent and easy to use.
I was able to re-tag a ton of artists and albums with Meta in no time at all.

![Meta](https://img.cleberg.io/blog/20220612-foss-macos-apps/meta.png)

#### Pictogram

- [Website](https://pictogramapp.com/)

Pictogram is a simple icon replacement app for macOS. If you have irregular icons in your
app drawer or dock, this app is a great tool to replace those icons. Personally, I
used this tool by downloading icons from [macOS Icons](https://macosicons.com/) and saving
them in an `icons` folder to be re-used later.

![Pictogram](https://img.cleberg.io/blog/20220612-foss-macos-apps/pictogram.png)

### Utilities

#### Little Snitch

- [Website](https://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/index.html)

Little Snitch is a powerful firewall that can set detailed rules on allowing and denying
connections per application, URL, or domain. The app has a ton of information dialogs that
can visualize where the requests are coming from or going to.

a program on the computer is using your microphone or camera.
