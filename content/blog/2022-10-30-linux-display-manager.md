## Display Manager Services

In order to change the [display 
manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_manager) on Void Linux - or any 
other Linux distro - you need to identify the currently enabled display manager.

### Disabling the Current Display Manager

Void Linux only has one ISO available for download with a pre-built display 
manager at the time of this post: the XFCE ISO. If you've installed this 
version, the pre-assigned display manager is `lxdm`. If you installed another 
display manager, replace `lxdm` in the following command with the display 
manager you have installed.

To disable `lxdm`, simply remove the service symlink:

```bash
sudo rm /var/service/lxdm
```

### Enabling a New Display Manager

If you want to enable a new display manager, you can do so after `lxdm` is 
disabled. Make sure to replace `<new_display_manager>` with your new DM, such as 
`gdm`, `xdm`, etc.


```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/sv/<new_display_manager> /var/service
```

## Set Up  `.xinitrc`

Depending on your setup, you may need to create a few X files, such as 
`~/.xinitrc`. For my personal set-up, I created this file to launch the i3wm as 
my desktop.

```bash
nano ~/.xinitrc
```

```bash
#!/bin/sh

exec i3
```

If you run a desktop other than i3, simply replace `i3` with the shell command 
that launches that desktop.

## Set Up Shell Profile

Finally, in order to automatically launch an X session upon login, you will need 
to edit the `.bash_profile` (bash) or `.zprofile` (zsh) files for your 
shell:

```bash
nano ~/.zprofile
```

Add the following snippet to the end of the shell profile file. This will 
execute the `startx` command upon login.

```bash
if [ -z "${DISPLAY}" ] && [ "${XDG_VTNR}" -eq 1 ]; then
	exec startx
fi
```

Alternatively, you can ignore this step and simply choose to manually execute 
`startx` upon login. This can be useful if you have issues with your desktop or 
like to manually launch different desktops by choice.
