## Shared Hosting vs. VPS

Choosing a place to host a website is one of the most confusing decisions for beginner web developers. Even for
experienced web devs, choosing between different forms of web hosting can be a daunting choice.

First, let's take a look at [shared web hosting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_web_hosting_service). Shared web
hosting is a product where you are purchasing a small piece of a web server that is being shared between many websites.
As a result, the cost of shared hosting is extremely low. You won't have access to the server itself, which means you
can't install your own software on the server, such as Docker. Usually, you are simply allowed to connect your domains
to the server, set up domain security, and other small utilities.

In contrast, a [virtual private server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server) (VPS) is a virtual machine
that replicates the environment of having a dedicated server to yourself. You are able to control the virtual server's
host names, base file system, package manager, etc. Another great upside of a VPS is that since it's virtual, the
company providing the VPS can dynamically increase the disk size, RAM size, or number of CPUs at any time. However, the
virtual server is still physically located on a server that is shared between multiple virtual servers.

The choice between shared hosting and VPS mostly depends on your skill level with system administration. If you're
comforting working on a server that is mostly left up to you (or you're willing to learn), then a VPS is usually a
better option. However, shared hosting is a fantastic option for people who don't want to have to learn how to manage
their server.

## My Situation

I had used shared hosting for approximately 5 years before trying my first VPS. I manage a homelab and have had success
running a server and performing typical sysadmin duties, but I was still hesitant to get a VPS. One fear was that I
always struggled to properly set up the networking part of a server - DNS and hostname configurations were not my
friend.

As a little bit of background, I originally used [Siteground](https://www.siteground.com) for my initial shared hosting
and stayed on that platform for at least a year. However, the UI was clunky, and I didn't like how they handled certain
technical aspects, so I switched to [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com). Namecheap was great because it is the
service I primarily use for purchasing domain names, which made it incredibly easy to link them to my hosting service.
However, it was still mediocre shared hosting and Namecheap is notorious for not letting you
use [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) to obtain free SSL/TLS certificates - Namecheap wants to make you purchase
certificates through their store.

Finally, I settled down with [iWebFusion](https://www.iwebfusion.net) for about the last year of my shared hosting. This
service was pretty great, came with free SSL/TLS, and I never had any complaints.

However, I finally grew tired of not being able to install software on my own web server. I wanted to be able to try out
things like [Postmill](https://postmill.xyz) or [Matrix](https://matrix.org). This is possible with a VPS, so I decided
to grab a new domain name to try it out.

## Getting Started: Buying a VPS

The first step to moving over to a VPS is (you guessed it): finding a VPS provider. For my VPSs, I
use [1984](https://1984hosting.com) and prefer their services much more than any alternative, due to their location (
Iceland), their [privacy policy](https://1984hosting.com/GDPR/), their respect for GDPR, and the ability to remain
anonymous if you pay in Bitcoin or Monero.

[Njalla](https://njal.la) is another good, privacy-oriented option for VPS services.

You'll have to decide what specifications you want on your VPS. For me, I only build and deploy low-resource HTML, PHP,
and Python websites. This means I can survive on the smallest VPS - 1 CPU, 1GB of RAM, and 25GB SSD for \$5.00 per
month.

As noted above, the great thing about a VPS is you can request your provider to increase the resources at any time.

## Configuring DNS Settings

Okay, so now let's get into some actual work that has to be done to get content moved from a shared host to a VPS. At
this point, I'm assuming you have a shared host with website content that you can still access, and you've purchased a
new VPS and can SSH into that server.

The first change is a minor one, but it should be done immediately in order to get things moving: DNS settings. Go to
wherever your DNS settings are handled. If your shared host also managed your DNS settings, you'll need to first move
that DNS over to your new VPS provider. For me, I route my DNS through [Gandi](https://www.gandi.net).

Once you know where your DNS settings are, go ahead and update the `A` records to match the public IP address of your
VPS. For example:

```text
A         example.com     xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
A         subdomain       xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
CNAME     www             example.com.
```

If you have any other records that require updates, such as MX or TXT records for a mail server, be sure to update those
accordingly. Personally, I don't host my own mail server - I route all mail on my custom domains
to [Migadu](https://www.migadu.com). Hosting your own email server can become complex quickly and is not for beginners.

DNS changes can take up to 48 hours to propagate, so be sure to give it some time before assuming you've made an error.

## Server Updates and Packages

Now that the DNS settings have been changed, let's set up our server while we wait for the DNS to propagate. First up is
to ssh into your server - if you've signed up with a service like DigitalOcean, you can add your SSH key to your account
and to your VPS droplet so that you don't need a password in order to SSH.

```bash
ssh root@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
```

The VPS that is used in this post runs Ubuntu 20.04 with an Apache web server. If you're working on a different
operating system (OS) or want a different web server, such as Nginx, you'll have to use different commands to set it up.

First, let's update and upgrade our server.

**NOTE:** Since we have logged in to the server as `root` for now, we don't need to use the `sudo` modifier before our
commands.

```bash
apt update && apt upgrade -y
```

## Create A User Account

While being able to use `root` can be beneficial at times, you shouldn't use `root` unless you have to.

So let's set up a new user in our system. The `-m` option below tells the OS to create a home directory for the new
user.

```bash
useradd -m USERNAME
```

Now, create a password for that user.

```bash
passwd USERNAME
```

Finally, add the user to the sudoers file so they can perform priveleged commands.

```bash
usermod -a -G sudo USERNAME
```

If you are using SSH keys and not passwords, you'll need to copy your SSH key from your local machine to the VPS. If you
haven't disabled password-based SSH yet, the easiest way to do this is `ssh-copy-id` from your local computer (not from
the VPS):

```bash
ssh-copy-id testuser@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
```

If you've disabled password-based SSH, you'll need to manually copy your SSH key into the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file.

## Install Software

Our goal here is to host a web server, so the next step is to install the Apache web server and any other packages we
need.

From this point on, I will be logged in as a user (not `root`) and will need to use the `sudo` modifier for most
commands.

```bash
sudo apt update; sudo apt upgrade -y; sudo apt autoremove -y
sudo apt install apache2
```

If you need other language support, such as PHP, you'll need to install that too.

```bash
sudo apt install libapache2-mod-php php-dom
sudo a2enmod php
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

## Website Files & Folders

Next up is to create the directories for the domain(s) we want to be hosted on this web server.

```bash
cd /var/www
sudo mkdir example.com
```

We have a folder for `example.com` now, so let's add an `index.html` file and put it within a specific `public_html`
folder. You don't need this `public_html` if you don't want it, but it helps with organizing items related
to `example.com` that you don't want published to the internet.

```bash
cd example.com
sudo mkdir public_html && cd public_html
sudo nano index.html
```

You can put anything you want in this `index.html` file. If you can't think of anything, paste this in there:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <title>Hello, world!</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Hello, world!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

If you want something to be served at `example.com/page01/file.txt`, you'll have to create the `page01` directory under
the `example.com` directory. For example:

```bash
cd /var/www/example.com/public_html
sudo mkdir page01
sudo nano file.txt
```

## Apache Configuration

Now, let's set up the files that will tell the server where to find the files for `example.com`. We will copy the
default configuration file and create our own.

```bash
cd /etc/apache2/sites-available
sudo cp 000-default.conf example.com.conf
sudo nano example.com.conf
```

This configuration file will have a few default lines, but you'll need to edit it to look similar to this (settings may
change based on your personal needs):

```text
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerAdmin your-email@email-provider.com
    ServerName example.com
    ServerAlias www.example.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/example.com/public_html
    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```

Now, enable the configuration for your new site, disable the default configuration, and reload the web server.

```bash
sudo a2ensite example.com.conf
sudo a2dissite 000-default.conf
sudo systemctl reload apache2
```

You can always run a test to make sure no errors or warnings are found in your configuration files.

```bash
sudo apache2ctl configtest
```

Now, restart the web server entirely. After this, you should be able to browse to `http://example.com` and see the HTML
content you provided earlier. Note that SSL/TLS has not been enabled yet, so you won't be able to use the secure version
yet (`https://example.com`).

```bash
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

You can repeat this for as many websites as you need. Just create the domain folders in `/var/www/`, add the
configuration file, enable the configuration, and restart `apache2`.

## SSL/TLS Certificates - Serve Websites Over HTTPS

In order to serve secure content, you'll need to obtain SSL/TLS certificates. Luckily there's a free tool
called [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org) that helps us with the process.

The first step is to install `snapd` and snap's `core` for Ubuntu.

```bash
sudo apt install snapd
sudo snap install core
sudo snap refresh core
```

Next, install the `certbot` snap package.

```bash
sudo snap install --classic certbot
```

Execute the following command to ensure that the `certbot` command can be run.

```bash
sudo ln -s /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot
```

Finally, you can run `certbot` one of two ways:

1. run it and let it alter your Apache configuration files automatically to enable HTTPS redirects/
2. run it and only allow it to create certificates - you'll need to manually alter the config files to enable HTTPS
   redirects.

Run certbot and allow automatic config changes:

```bash
sudo certbot --apache
```

Run certbot for certificates only - don't allow it to alter config files:

```bash
sudo certbot certonly --apache
```

The Certbot packages on your system come with a cron job or systemd timer that will renew your certificates
automatically before they expire. You will not need to run Certbot again, unless you change your configuration. You can
test automatic renewal for your certificates by running this command:

```bash
sudo certbot renew --dry-run
```

Now, test your domains by going to `https://example.com`.

## Firewall Security

To enable better security on your server, you'll need to enable a basic firewall. For Ubuntu, we'll
use [the uncomplicated firewall](https://cleberg.io/blog/secure-your-network-with-the-uncomplicated-firewall.html).

Now, add the following rules to the firewall allow SSH, Apache, and HTTP(S) connections. If you need to, you can enable
different ports for specifics applications, SFTP, etc.

```bash
sudo ufw allow OpenSSH
sudo ufw allow Apache
sudo ufw allow proto tcp from any to any port 80,443
```

Once you've added all the rules you need, enable the firewall.

```bash
sudo ufw enable
```

## Troubleshooting

If you run into any issues during your VPS set-up, be sure to walk back through your actions and make sure you didn't
miss any steps.

Many websites have fantastic guides to setting up various web servers - this is one of the
areas [where DigitalOcean shines](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials). For simpler or more Linux-oriented
questions, I suggest using [Linuxize](https://linuxize.com).

If you're getting certain errors (e.g. `500 Internal Server Error`) and need to debug locally, you can view
the `access.log` and `error.log` files in the `/var/log/apache/` directory.
