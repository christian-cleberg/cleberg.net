## Uncomplicated Firewall

Uncomplicated Firewall, also known as ufw, is a convenient and beginner-friendly
way to enforce OS-level firewall rules. For those who are hosting servers or any
device that is accessible to the world (i.e. by public IP or domain name), it's
critical that a firewall is properly implemented and active.

Ufw is available by default in all Ubuntu installations after 8.04 LTS. For
other distributions, you can look to install ufw or check if there are
alternative firewalls installed already. There are usually alternatives
available, such as Fedora's `firewall` and the package available on most
distributions: `iptables`. ufw is considered a beginner-friendly front-end to
iptables.

[Gufw](https://gufw.org) is available as a graphical user interface (GUI)
application for users who are uncomfortable setting up a firewall through a
terminal.

## Getting Help

If you need help figuring out commands, remember that you can run the `--help`
flag to get a list of options.

```bash
sudo ufw --help
```

## Set Default State

The proper way to run a firewall is to set a strict default state and slowly
open up ports that you want to allow. This helps prevent anything malicious from
slipping through the cracks. The following command prevents all incoming traffic
(other than the rules we specify later), but you can also set this for outgoing
connections, if necessary.

```bash
sudo ufw default deny incoming
```

You should also allow outgoing traffic if you want to allow the device to
communicate back to you or other parties. For example, media servers like Plex
need to be able to send out data related to streaming the media.

```bash
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
```

## Adding Port Rules

Now that we've disabled all incoming traffic by default, we need to open up some
ports (or else no traffic would be able to come in). If you need to be able to
`ssh` into the machine, you'll need to open up port 22.

```bash
sudo ufw allow 22
```

You can also issue more restrictive rules. The following rule will allow `ssh`
connections only from machines on the local subnet.

```bash
sudo ufw allow proto tcp from 192.168.0.0/24 to any port 22
```

If you need to set a rule that isn't tcp, just append your connection type to
the end of the rule.

```bash
sudo ufw allow 1900/udp
```

## Enable ufw

Now that the firewall is configured and ready to go, you can enable the
firewall.

```bash
sudo ufw enable
```

A restart may be required for the firewall to begin operating.

```bash
sudo reboot now
```

## Checking Status

Now that the firewall is enabled, let's check and see what the rules look like.

```bash
sudo ufw status numbered
```

```txt
Status: active

     To                    Action      From
     --                    ------      ----
[ 1] 22                    ALLOW IN    Anywhere
[ 2] 22 (v6)               ALLOW IN    Anywhere (v6)
```

## Deleting Rules

If you need to delete a rule, you need to know the number associated with that
rule. Let's delete the first rule in the table above - you'll be asked to
confirm the deletion.

```bash
sudo ufw delete 1
```

## Managing App Rules

Luckily, there's a convenient way for installed applications to create files
that ufw can easily implement so that you don't have to search and find which
ports your application requires. To see if your device has any applications with
pre-installed ufw rules, execute the following command:

```bash
sudo ufw app list
```

The results should look something like this:

```txt
Available applications:
    OpenSSH
    Samba
    plexmediaserver
    plexmediaserver-all
    plexmediaserver-dlna
```

If you want to get more information on a specific app rule, use the `info`
command.

```bash
sudo ufw app info plexmediaserver-dlna
```

You'll get a blurb of info back like this:

```txt
Profile: plexmediaserver-dlna
Title: Plex Media Server (DLNA)
Description: The Plex Media Server (additional DLNA capability only)

Ports:
    1900/udp
    32469/tcp
```

You can add or delete app rules the same way that you'd add or delete specific
port rules.

```bash
sudo ufw allow plexmediaserver-dlna
```

```bash
sudo ufw delete RULE|NUM
```

## Creating App Rules

If you'd like to create you own app rule, you'll need to create a file in the
`/etc/ufw/applications.d` directory. Within the file you create, you need to
make sure the content is properly formatted.

For example, here are the contents my `plexmediaserver` file, which creates
three distinct app rules for ufw:

```config
[plexmediaserver]
title=Plex Media Server (Standard)
description=The Plex Media Server
ports=32400/tcp|3005/tcp|5353/udp|8324/tcp|32410:32414/udp

[plexmediaserver-dlna]
title=Plex Media Server (DLNA)
description=The Plex Media Server (additional DLNA capability only)
ports=1900/udp|32469/tcp

[plexmediaserver-all]
title=Plex Media Server (Standard + DLNA)
description=The Plex Media Server (with additional DLNA capability)
ports=32400/tcp|3005/tcp|5353/udp|8324/tcp|32410:32414/udp|1900/udp|32469/tcp
```

So, if I wanted to create a custom app rule called "mycustomrule", I'd create a
file and add my content like this:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ufw/applications.d/mycustomrule
```

```config
[mycustomrule]
title=My Custom Rule
description=This is a temporary ufw app rule.
ports=88/tcp|9100/udp
```

Then, I would just enable this rule in ufw.

```bash
sudo ufw allow mycustomrule
```
