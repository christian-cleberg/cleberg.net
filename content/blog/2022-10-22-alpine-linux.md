## Alpine Linux

[Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org) is a very small distro, built on musl 
libc and busybox. It uses ash as the default shell, OpenRC as the init 
system, and apk as the package manager. According to their website, an Alpine 
container "requires no more than 8 MB and a minimal installation to disk 
requires around 130 MB of storage." An actual bare metal machine is recommended 
to have 100 MB of RAM and 0-700 MB of storage space.

Historically, I've used Ubuntu's minimal installation image as my server OS for 
the last five years. Ubuntu worked well and helped as my original server 
contained an nVidia GPU and no onboard graphics, so quite a few distros won't 
boot or install without a lot of tinkering.

Alpine has given me a huge increase in performance across my Docker apps and 
Nginx websites. CPU load for the new server I'm using to test Alpine hovers 
around 0-5% on average with an Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-6100 CPU @ 3.70GHz.

The only services I haven't moved over to Alpine are Plex Media Server and 
Syncthing, which may increase CPU load quite a bit depending on how many 
streams are running.

### Installation

In terms of installation, Alpine has an incredibly useful 
[wiki](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Installation) that will guide a user 
throughout the installation and post-installation processes, as well as various 
other articles and guides.

To install Alpine, find an appropriate [image to 
download](https://alpinelinux.org/downloads/) and flash it to a USB using 
software such as Rufus or Etcher. I opted to use the Standard image for my 
x86_64 architecture.

Once the USB is ready, plug it into the machine and reboot - you may have to use 
a key such as `Esc` or `F1-12` to access the boot menu. The Alpine Linux 
terminal will load quickly and for a login.

To login to the installation image, use the `root` account; there is no 
password. Once logged-in, execute the setup command:

```sh
setup-alpine
```

The setup script will ask a series of questions to configure the system. Be sure 
to answer carefully or else you may have to re-configure the system after boot.

- Keyboard Layout (Local keyboard language and usage mode, e.g. us and variant 
of us-nodeadkeys.)
- Hostname (The name for the computer.)
- Network (For example, automatic IP address discovery with the "DHCP" 
protocol.)
- DNS Servers (Domain Name Servers to query. For privacy reasons it is NOT 
recommended to route every local request to servers like google's 8.8.8.8 .)
- Timezone
- Proxy (Proxy server to use for accessing the web. Use "none" for direct 
connections to the internet.)
- Mirror (From where to download packages. Choose the organization you trust 
giving your usage patterns to.)
- SSH (Secure SHell remote access server. "Openssh" is part of the default 
install image. Use "none" to disable remote login, e.g. on laptops.)
- NTP (Network Time Protocol client used for keeping the system clock in sync 
with a time server. Package "chrony" is part of the default install image.)
- Disk Mode (Select between diskless (disk="none"), "data" or "sys", as 
described above.)

Once the setup script is finished, be sure to reboot the machine and remove the 
USB device.

```sh
reboot
```

### Post-Installation

There are many things you can do once your Alpine Linux system is up and running 
and it largely depends on what you'll use the machine for. I'm going to walk 
through my personal post-installation setup for my web server.

#### Upgrade the System

First, login as `root` in order to update and upgrade the system:

```sh
apk -U upgrade
```

#### Adding a User

I needed to add a user so that I don't need to login in as root. Note that if 
you're used to using the `sudo` command, you will now need to use the `doas` 
command on Alpine Linux.

```sh
apk add doas
adduser <username>
adduser <username> wheel
```

You can now logout and log back in using the newly-created user:

```sh
exit
```

#### Enable Community Packages

In order to install more common packages that aren't found in the `main` 
repository, you will need to enable the `community` repository:

```sh
doas nano /etc/apk/repositories
```

Uncomment the community line for whichever version of Alpine you're running:

```sh
/media/usb/apks
http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.16/main
http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.16/community
#http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/edge/main
#http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/edge/community
#http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/edge/testing
```

#### Install Required Packages

Now that the community packages are available, you can install any packages you 
need. In my case, I installed the web server packages I need for my services:

```sh
doas apk add nano nginx docker docker-compose ufw
```

#### SSH

If you didn't install OpenSSH as part of the installation, you can do so now:

```sh
doas apk add openssh
```

Next, either create a new key or copy your SSH key to the server from your 
current machines:

```sh
# Create a new key
ssh-keygen
```

If you need to copy an existing SSH key from a current machine:

```sh
# Copy key from existing machines
ssh-copy-id <username>@<ip_address>
```

#### Firewall

Lastly, I installed `ufw` above as my firewall. To setup, default to deny 
incoming and allow outgoing connections. Then selectively allow other ports or 
apps as needed.

```sh
doas ufw default deny incoming
doas ufw default allow outgoing
doas ufw allow SSH
doas ufw allow "WWW Full"
doas ufw allow 9418 # Git server port
``` 

#### Change Hostname

If you don't like the hostname set during installation, you just need to edit 
two files. First, edit the simple hostname file:

```sh
doas nano /etc/hostname
```

```sh
<hostname>
```

Next, edit the hosts file:

```sh
doas nano /etc/hosts
```

```sh
127.0.0.1	<hostname>.local <hostname> localhost.local localhost
::1		    <hostname> <hostname>.local
```

## Nginx Web Server

To set-up my web server, I simply created the `www` user and created the 
necessary files.

```sh
doas adduser -D -g 'www' www
mkdir /www
doas mkdir /www
doas chown -R www:www /var/lib/nginx/
doas chown -R www:www /www
```

If you're running a simple webroot, you can alter the main `nginx.conf` file. 
Otherwise, you can drop configuration files in the following directory. You 
don't need to enable or symlink the configuration file like you do in other 
systems.

```sh
doas nano /etc/nginx/http.d/example_website.conf
```

Once the configuration is set and pointed at the `/www` directory to serve 
files, enable the Nginx service:

```sh
# Note that 'default' must be included or Nginx will not start on boot
doas rc-update add nginx default
```

## Docker Containers

Docker works exactly the same as other systems. Either execute a `docker run` 
command or create a `docker-compose.yml` file and do `docker-compose up -d`.

## Git Server

I went in-depth on how to self-host a git server in another post: 
[Self-Hosting a Personal Git Server](/blog/git-server/).

However, there are a few differences with Alpine. First note that in order to 
change the `git` user's shell, you must do a few things a little different:

```sh
doas apk add libuser
doas touch /etc/login.defs
doas mkdir /etc/default
doas touch /etc/default/useradd
doas lchsh git
```

## Thoughts on Alpine

So far, I love Alpine Linux. I have no complaints about anything at this point, 
but I'm not completely finished with the migration yet. Once I'm able to upgrade 
my hardware to a rack-mounted server, I will migrate Plex and Syncthing over to 
Alpine as well - possibly putting Plex into a container or VM.

The performance is stellar, the `apk` package manager is seamless, and system 
administration tasks are effortless. My only regret is that I didn't 
install Alpine sooner.
