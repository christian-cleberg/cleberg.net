## Fedora i3's Login Manager

Since I use the i3 spin of Fedora Workstation, I don't like to have a login 
manager installed by default. As of the current version of Fedora i3, the 
default login manager is LightDM.

If this is no longer the case, you can search for currently-installed packages 
with the following command and see if you can identify a different login 
manager.

```sh
sudo dnf list installed
```

## Removing the Login Manager

In order to remove the login manager, simply uninstall the package.

```sh
sudo dnf remove lightdm
```

## Launching i3 Manually

In order to launch i3 manually, you need to set-up your X session properly. To 
start, create or edit the `~/.xinitrc` file to include the following at the 
bottom.

```config
exec i3
```

Now, whenever you log in to the TTY, you can launch your desktop with the 
following command.

```sh
startx
```
