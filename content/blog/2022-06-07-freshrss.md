## Why RSS?

After noticing that I have collected 50+ blogs as bookmarks, I decided to
migrate back to using RSS feeds to stay up-to-date with my favorite websites.
Using RSS allows me to read all of these posts in a single app (on both mobile &
desktop) and allows me to be notified when new posts are available.

However, I ran into one issue: syncing subscriptions and read/unread posts
across devices. Since I want to be able to easily read on both mobile and
desktop, I decided to look for a self-hosted RSS solution.

Thus, I found [FreshRSS](https://www.freshrss.org/) and was able to successfully
install it on my server in about 30 minutes. Continue reading to learn more or
skip to the [screenshots](#screenshots) section to see the finished product.

## Documentation

While it's certainly not robust, the
[FreshRSS documentation](https://freshrss.github.io/FreshRSS/) is helpful for
figuring out basic information about the service.

However, I wanted to install this service as a Docker container and stumbled
across the
[Docker README](https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS/tree/edge/Docker) within
the GitHub repository.

This README was the documentation I actually needed. However, as you'll see
below, I still had to manually edit one file (`config.php`) to access the API
externally via my RSS apps.

## Installation

### DNS

The first step, as required by any external web service, was assigning a domain
name to use. I chose to use a subdomain, like `rss.cleberg.net`.

To assign this, I created an `A` record in my DNS settings with the IPv4 address
of the server and an `AAAA` record with the IPv6 address of the server. Note:
assigning an IPv6 (`AAAA`) record is optional, but I like to enable IPV6 for my
services.

```config
rss.cleberg.net     A       xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
rss.cleberg.net     AAAA    xxxx:xxxx: ... :xxxx
```

### Docker

I initially tried to set-up a `docker-compose.yml` file with a `.env` file
because I prefer to have a file I can look back at later to see how I initially
started the container, but it simply wouldn't work for me. I'm not sure why, but
I assume I wasn't telling `docker-compose` where the `.env` file was.

Regardless, I chose to simply run the service with `docker run`. See the
following command for my `docker run` configuration:

```bash
sudo docker run -d --restart unless-stopped --log-opt max-size=10m \
  -p 8080:80 \
  -e TZ=America/Chicago \
  -e 'CRON_MIN=1,31' \
  -v freshrss_data:/var/www/FreshRSS/data \
  -v freshrss_extensions:/var/www/FreshRSS/extensions \
  --name freshrss \
  freshrss/freshrss
```

This started the container successfully and allowed me to visit the FreshRSS
instance at `localhost:8080`.

### FreshRSS Set-Up

:warning: I **HIGHLY** suggest that you set up your user account prior to
exposing this service to the public. It's unlikely that someone is trying to
access the exact domain or IP/port you're assigning here, but as soon as you
expose this service, the first person to open the URL will be able to create the
admin user.

In order to set-up your FreshRSS service, open the `localhost:8080` URL in your
browser (you may need to use a local IP instead of `localhost` if you're
accessing the page from a different machine on the network - e.g.,
`192.168.1.20:8080`).

Once the page loads, set-up your default user with a strong username and
password. You may also choose to configure other settings prior to exposing this
service.

### Nginx Reverse-Proxy

In order to access this service outside my home, I needed to set-up a
reverse-proxy to connect `localhost:8080` to `rss.cleberg.net`.

First, I created a new Nginx configuration file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/rss.cleberg.net
```

Within the config file, I pasted the following code:

```config
upstream freshrss {
        server 127.0.0.1:8080;
        keepalive 64;
}

server {
        server_name rss.cleberg.net;
        listen 80;

        location / {
                # The final `/` is important.
                proxy_pass http://localhost:8080/;
                add_header X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN;
                add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block";
                proxy_redirect off;
                proxy_buffering off;
                proxy_set_header Host $host;
                proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
                proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
                proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
                proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Port $server_port;
                proxy_read_timeout 90;

                # Forward the Authorization header for the Google Reader API.
                proxy_set_header Authorization $http_authorization;
                proxy_pass_header Authorization;
        }
}
```

Finally, restart Nginx and you will be able to access your service via HTTP:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx.service
```

### HTTPS

However, I don't want to access my RSS feeds via HTTP. I want it available only
via HTTPS. In order to do this, I ran the [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/)
program to generate SSL certificates for me:

```bash
sudo certbot --nginx
```

This process will automatically generate an SSL certificate for you and modify
the Nginx configuration file to include a redirect from HTTP to HTTPS.

## Post-Installation Fixes

At this point, we have a functional FreshRSS website, available from anywhere
and secured with HTTPS. However, attempting to connect this service to an RSS
app resulted in many errors regarding unavailable URLs and incorrect
credentials.

### API Set-Up

First, you need to open your user profile in FreshRSS (`Settings` > `Profile`)
and set an API password in the field at the bottom. This is the password you
will need to provide to your RSS apps.

Once that is set and saved, click the link below the API password field to open
the API check tool. It should look something like `https://localhost:8080/api/`
or `https://rss.example.com/api/`.

Within this page, you _should_ see your correct external URL and "PASS" at the
bottom of each API type. This would mean everything is set-up correctly and you
can now move on and login to any RSS apps that support self-hosted options.

In my case, the URL showed an internal URL and I had a warning that the
`base_url` variable may be misconfigured. If this is the case, see the next
section for a fix.

**API Check Tool:**

### Base URL Fix

In order to fix the `base_url` for the API, I opened up my docker container with
the following command:

```bash
sudo docker exec -it freshrss bash
```

Within this container, update the packages and install an editor:

```bash
apt-get update
apt-get install nano
```

Finally, open up `config.php` in the `data` directory:

```bash
nano data/config.php
```

Within `config.php`, you will need to update the `base_url` variable and update
it to match your external URL. In my case, I simply commented-out the incorrect
URL with `//` and added the correct one on a new line:

```php
<?php
    return array (
        ...
        //  'base_url' => 'http://localhost:8080',
        'base_url' => 'https://rss.cleberg.net',
        ...
    )
>
```

You can now exit the file with `Ctrl + x`, press `y` to save the file, and then
click `Enter` to keep the same file name.

Finally, just exit out of the docker container:

```bash
exit
```

Next, just restart the container:

```bash
sudo docker restart freshrss
```

Voil√†! Your API check should now "PASS" and you should be able to use one of the
API URLs in your RSS apps.

In my case, I use [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com) on my desktop and
phone:

## Screenshots

**Note**: I switched to the `Dark` theme in the FreshRSS settings, so it may
look a little different than your installation if you haven't changed themes.
