## Running Flatpak Apps Should Be Faster

If you're like me and use Flatpak for those pesky apps that cannot run on your
system for one reason or another, you likely get annoyed with opening a terminal
and manually running the Flatpak app with the lengthy `flatpak run ...` command.

In the past, I manually created aliases in my `.zshrc` file for certain apps.
For example, an alias would look like the example below.

This would allow me to run the command fast within the terminal - but it
wouldn't allow me to run it in an application launcher.

```sh
# ~/.zshrc
alias librewolf = "flatpak run io.gitlab.librewolf-community"
```

However, I now use a much faster and better method that integrates with the
tiling WMs I use and their application launchers - `dmenu` and `bemenu`.

## Creating Symlinks for Flatpak Apps

Let's use the example of Librewolf below. I can install the application like so:

```sh
flatpak install flathub io.gitlab.librewolf-community
```

Once installed, I can create a symlink to link the flatpak app to my new symlink
in a location commonly included in your PATH. In this case, I chose `/usr/bin`.
You may need to choose a different location if `/usr/bin` isn't in your PATH.

```sh
ln -s /var/lib/flatpak/exports/bin/io.gitlab.librewolf-community /usr/bin/librewolf
```

Once complete, you should be able to launch the app using the command name you
chose above in the symlink (`librewolf`) from a terminal or from your
application launcher!
