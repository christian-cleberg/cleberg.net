## The History of GPG

[GNU Privacy Guard](https://gnupg.org/), also known as GnuPG and GPG, is a free 
("free" as in both speech and beer) software that fully implements the OpenPGP 
Message Format documented in [RFC 4880](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4880).

I won't go in-depth on the full history of the software in this post, but it is 
important to understand that GPG is not the same as PGP (Pretty Good Privacy), 
which is a different implementation of RFC 4880. However, GPG was designed to 
interoperate with PGP.

GPG was originally developed in the late 1990s by [Werner 
Koch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_Koch) and has historically been 
funded generously by the German government.

## Platforms

Originally developed as a command-line program for *nix systems, GPG now has a 
wealth of front-end applications and libraries available for end-users. However, 
the most recommended programs remain the same:

- [GnuPG](https://gnupg.org) for Linux (depending on distro)
- [Gpg4in](https://gpg4win.org) for Windows
- [GPGTools](https://gpgtools.org) for macOS

## Common Usage

As noted in RFC 4880, the general functions of OpenPGP are as follows:

- digital signatures
- encryption
- compression
- Radix-64 conversion
- key management and certificate services

From this, you can probably gather that the main use of GPG is for encrypting 
data and/or signing the data with a key. The purpose of encrypting data with GPG 
is to ensure that no one except the intended recipient(s) can access the data.

### Email

TODO: Discuss the following situations (with examples):

1. Signatures on unencrypted emails
2. Encrypted emails

### Ownership Signatures

TODO: Discuss the following for developers:

e.g., `git` commits

### File Encryption

TODO: Discuss basic file encryption

Sender:
```bash
gpg --encrypt --output file.gpg --recipient recipient@example.com file
```

Recipient:
```bash
gpg --decrypt --output file file.gpg
```
