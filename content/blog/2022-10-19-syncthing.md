## An Overview of Syncthing

If you've been looking around the self-hosted cloud storage space for a while, 
you've undoubtedly run into someone suggesting 
[Syncthing](https://syncthing.net) as an option. However, it is an unusual 
alternative for those users out there who are used to having a centralized cloud 
server that serves as the "controller" of the data and interacts with clients on 
devices to fetch files.

This post is a walkthough of the Syncthing software, how I set-up my personal 
storage, and some pros and cons of using the software.

## Installing Syncthing

To install Syncthing, visit the [Downloads](https://syncthing.net/downloads/) 
page or install via your device's package manager.

### Server & Desktop

You can install Syncthing on servers and desktops via the Downloads page linked 
above or via the command-line.

For Debian-based distros:

```bash
sudo apt install syncthing
```

For Fedora-based distros:

```bash
sudo dnf install syncthing
```

### Mobile

Syncthing for Android is available on 
[F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.nutomic.syncthingandroid/) and 
[Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nutomic.syncthingandroid).
Syncthing does not have an official iOS client, but there is a third-party 
client called [Möbius 
Sync](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/m%C3%B6bius-sync/id1539203216).

## How Does Syncthing Work?

To start, I wanted to include the main marketing blurb from their website:

> Syncthing is a continuous file synchronization program. It synchronizes files 
> between two or more computers in real time, safely protected from prying eyes. 
> Your data is your data alone and you deserve to choose where it is stored, 
> whether it is shared with some third party, and how it's transmitted over the 
> internet.

Let's break this apart and add in some other details to help explain what 
exactly Syncthing does in order to sync files between devices.

### Local Syncthing Server(s)

Syncthing syncs files between multiple devices by creating a local server on 
each device. These local servers handle a few different things, such as 
watching files and directories for changes, hosting an adminstrative GUI 
website, and authenticating with connected devices.

You can also start, stop, and restart the Syncthing server via the command-line 
or web dashboard. If you're running Syncthing on a device with `systemd`, you 
can use the following commands:

```bash
sudo systemctl start syncthing@username.service
sudo systemctl restart syncthing@username.service
sudo systemctl stop syncthing@username.service
```

### Syncthing Dashboard

This biggest part of Syncthing is the admin GUI website that runs on each 
device (note that mobile devices will use the Syncthing app rather than the 
web GUI). The admin GUI is available through the web browser on the 
local device that is running Syncthing - simply go to `http://localhost:8384` 
or `http://127.0.0.1:8384`. This web page is the place where you will change 
settings, add/modify synced files, and add/modify connected devices.

Here's an example web GUI dashboard:

### Remote Devices

A cloud storage solution wouldn't be very useful if you aren't able to share 
data among various devices. Syncthing does this by sharing Device IDs to connect 
servers, and then by manually sharing Folders with devices that have been 
connected.

For instance, if you have a laptop running Syncthing and then install the 
Syncthing mobile app on a phone, you could scan the laptop's QR code for Device 
ID and then accept the authentication on the laptop's dashboard. Next, you can 
use either device to select a folder for sharing and dictating which device 
should send, receive, or both.

When you connect devices, you can set one device as an "Introducer", which can 
add devices from the introducer to the device list, for mutually shared folders. 
You can also configure Auto Accept, compression, rate limits, and more settings 
per device.

## My Personal Cloud Storage Set-up

Personally, I use a model similar to a traditional cloud storage service. I have 
a "centralized" server running 24/7 that acts as an Introducer for my Syncthing 
network. I think of this as my main storage and all other devices as tertiary 
client devices. I will likely add additional servers as backups as time goes on 
so that I don't have to rely on my laptop or phone as the only backups.

Currently, I have one desktop and one mobile device connected to the network, 
both running intermittently as they are not powered-on 24/7.

The initial set-up of the software was easy enough, but data transfer rates were 
incredibly slow for me due to the Wi-Fi. Instead, I plugged my laptop into the 
ethernet network that my server is on and manually copied my folders over to the 
server with `scp`. Once complete, Syncthing validated that all files were there 
and not missing and it did not need to transfer any data through the WAN.

As slow as the transfer was going, this probably saved me a few days of waiting 
for my ~100GB sync.

## Pros & Cons

I've put together a short list of pros and cons for Syncthing. I thought about 
my experiences with Nextcloud, WebDAV, proprietary services (Google Drive, 
iCloud, etc.), and privacy-focused cloud solutions (pCloud, Tresorit, etc.).

**Pros:**

- I've faced no data loss at all through my two-month trial run.
- No third-parties store your data on their servers.
- You have full control over your data and can take your data and leave at any 
time.
- It's possible to encrypt client-side easily with software like Cryptomator.
- No propietary clients or mounted volumes, just plain files and folders.

**Cons:**

- The learning curve is steeper than traditional cloud services and is focused 
on a technical audience.
- If a device needs to modify files in a Folder, the devices will need to sync 
ALL files from the folder, which may be large in size. To avoid size restraints, 
split large folders into smaller folders for syncing.
- Syncing can be slow, usually due to the clients/servers initially 
connecting or re-connecting after sleeping.
- Multiple personal devices are required and require the user to own or rent 
them as no third-party servers are involved in the storage of data.

Overall, I've had a great experience with Syncthing so far. I've had no data 
loss, syncing has been quick and easy when changes are made to files, device 
connections are reliable, and I love the freedom of controlling the clients and 
servers as I choose.

Not to mention that I appreciate that I - or someone else - could pull all of 
the Syncthing [source code](https://github.com/syncthing) and continue 
development/support if the Syncthing Foundation decides to stop developing the 
software or sells the business.
