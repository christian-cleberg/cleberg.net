## Leaving macOS

As I noted [in a recent post](/blog/foss-macos-apps), I have been planning on 
migrating from macOS back to a Linux-based OS. I am happy to say that I have 
finally completed my migration and am now stuck in the wonderful world of Linux 
again.

My decision to leave macOS really came down to just a few, important things:

- Apple Security (Gatekeeper) restricting me from running any software I want. 
Even if you disable Gatekeeper and allow a software to bypass the rest of the 
device installation security, you still have to repeat that process every time 
the allowed software is updated.
- macOS sends out nearly constant connections, pings, telemetry, etc. to a 
myriad of mysterious Apple services. I'm not even going to dive into how many 
macOS apps have constant telemetry on, as well.
- Lastly, I just *really* missed the customization and freedom that comes with 
Linux. Being able to switch to entirely new kernel, OS, or desktop within 
minutes is a freedom I took for granted when I switched to macOS.

Now that I've covered macOS, I'm going to move on to more exciting topics: my 
personal choice of OS, DE, and various customizations I'm using.

## Fedora

After trying a ton of distros (I think I booted and tested around 20-25 
distros), I finally landed on [Fedora Linux](https://getfedora.org/). I have 
quite a bit of experience with Fedora and enjoy the `dnf` package manager. 
Fedora allows me to keep up-to-date with recent software (I'm looking at you, 
Debian), but still provides a level of stability you don't find in every distro.

In a very close second place was Arch Linux, as well as its spinoff: Garuda 
Linux (Garuda w/ sway is *beautiful*). Arch is great for compatibility and the 
massive community it has, but I have just never had the time to properly sit 
down and learn the methodology behind their packaging systems.

Basically everything else I tested was unacceptable in at least one way or 
another. Void (`glibc`) was great, but doesn't support all of the software I 
need. Slackware worked well as a tui, but I wasn't skilled enough to get a 
tiling window manager (WM) working on it.

### i3

![i3wm](https://img.cleberg.net/blog/20220624-fedora-i3/i3wm.png)

One of the reasons I settled on Fedora is that it comes with an official i3 
spin. Being able to use a tiling WM, such as i3 or sway, is one of the biggest 
things I wanted to do as soon as I adopted Linux again.

I will probably set-up a dotfile repository soon, so that I don't lose any of my 
configurations, but nothing big has been configured thus far.

The two main things I have updated in i3wm are natural scrolling and binding my 
brightness keys to the `brightnessctl` program.

#### Natural Scrolling

You can enable natural scrolling by the opening the following file:

```sh
sudo nano /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/40-libinput.conf
```

Within the `40-libinput.conf` file, find the following input sections and enable 
the natural scrolling option.

This is the `pointer` section:

```conf
Section "InputClass"
        Identifier "libinput pointer catchall"
        MatchIsPointer "on"
        MatchDevicePath "/dev/input/event*"
        Driver "libinput"
        Option "NaturalScrolling" "True"
EndSection
```

This is the `touchpad` section:

```conf
Section "InputClass"
        Identifier "libinput touchpad catchall"
        MatchIsTouchpad "on"
        MatchDevicePath "/dev/input/event*"
        Driver "libinput"
        Option "NaturalScrolling" "True"
EndSection
```

#### Enabling Brightness Keys

Likewise, enabling brightness key functionality is as simple as binding the keys 
to the `brightnessctl` program.

To do this, open up your i3 config file. Mine is located here:

```sh
nano /home/<my-user>/.config/i3/config
```

```conf
# Use brightnessctl to adjust brightness.
bindsym XF86MonBrightnessDown exec --no-startup-id brightnessctl --min-val=2 -q set 3%-
bindsym XF86MonBrightnessUp exec --no-startup-id brightnessctl -q set 3%+
```

#### `polybar`

Instead of using the default `i3status` bar, I have opted to use `polybar` 
instead (as you can also see in the screenshot above).

My config for this menu bar is basically just the default settings with modified 
colors and an added battery block to quickly show me the machine's battery info.

#### `alacritty`

Not much to say on this part yet, as I haven't configured it much, but I 
installed `alacritty` as my default terminal and am using `zsh` and the shell.

## Software Choices

Again, I'm not going to say much that I haven't said already in other blog 
posts, so I'll just do a quick rundown of the apps I installed immediately after 
I set-up the environment.

Flatpak Apps:

- Cryptomator
- pCloud
- Signal

Fedora Packages:

- gomuks
- neomutt
- neofetch
- Firefox
  - uBlock Origin
  - Bitwarden
  - Stylus
  - Privacy Redirect

Other:

- exiftool
