## Introduction

After using iOS for a couple years, I finally took the plunge and purchased a 
Pixel 6 Pro in order to test and use [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org).

The installation process was rather quick once you have the tools and files you 
need. Overall, it can be done in just a few minutes.

## Gathering Tools & Files

### Android Tools

First, in order to interact with the device, we will need the [Android 
platform 
tools](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools.html). Find 
the Linux download and save the ZIP folder to your preferred location.

Once we've downloaded the the files, we will need to unzip them, enter the 
directory, and move the necessary executables to a central location, such as 
`/usr/bin/`. For this installation, we only need the `fastboot` and `adb` 
executables.

```sh
cd ~/Downloads
```

```sh
unzip platform-tools_r33.0.3-linux.zip
cd platform-tools
sudo mv fastboot /usr/bin/
sudo mv adb /usr/bin
```

### GrapheneOS Files

Next, we need the [GrapheneOS files](https://grapheneos.org/releases) for 
our device and model. For example, the Pixel 6 Pro is codenamed `raven` on the 
releases page.

Once we have the links, let's download them to our working directory:

```sh
curl -O https://releases.grapheneos.org/factory.pub
curl -0 https://releases.grapheneos.org/raven-factory-2022091400.zip
curl -0 https://releases.grapheneos.org/raven-factory-2022091400.zip.sig
```

#### Validate Integrity

In order to validate the integrity of the downloaded files, we will need the 
`signify` package and Graphene's `factory.pub` file.

```sh
sudo dnf install signify
```

```sh
curl -O https://releases.grapheneos.org/factory.pub
```

Then we can validate the files and ensure that no data was corrupted or 
modified before it was saved to our device.

```sh
signify -Cqp factory.pub -x raven-factory-2022091400.zip.sig && echo verified
```

#### Unzip Files

Once the files are verified, we can unzip the Graphene image and enter the 
directory:

```sh
unzip raven-factory-2022091400.zip && cd raven-factory-2022091400
```

## Installation Process

### Enable Developer Debugging & OEM Unlock

Before we can actually flash anything to the phone, we will need to enable 
OEM Unlocking, as well as either USB Debugging or Wireless Debugging, depending on 
which method we will be using.

To start, enable developer mode by going to `Settings` > `About` and tapping 
`Build Number` seven (7) times. You may need to enter your PIN to enable this 
mode.

Once developer mode is enabled, go to `Settings` > `System` > `Devloper 
Options` and enable OEM Unlocking, as well as USB or Wireless Debugging. In my 
case, I chose USB Debugging and performed all actions via USB cable.

Once these options are enabled, plug the phone into the computer and execute the 
following command:

```sh
adb devices
```

If an unauthorized error occurs, make sure the USB mode on the phone is 
changedfrom charging to something like "File Transfer" or "PTP". You can find 
the USB mode in the notification tray.

### Reboot Device

Once we have found the device via `adb`, we can either boot into the 
bootloader interface by holding the volume down button while the phone reboots 
or by executing the following command:

```sh
adb reboot bootloader
```

### Unlock the Bootloader

The phone will reboot and load the bootloader screen upon startup. At this 
point, we are ready to start the actual flashing of GrapheneOS onto the device.

**NOTE**: In my situation, I needed to use `sudo` with every `fastboot` 
command, but not with `adb` commands. I am not sure if this is standard or a 
Fedora quirk, but I'm documenting my commands verbatim in this post.

First, we start by unlocking the bootloader so that we can load other ROMs:

```sh
sudo fastboot flashing unlock
```

### Flashing Factory Images

Once the phone is unlocked, we can flash it with the `flash-all.sh` script found 
inside the `raven-factory-2022091400` folder we entered earlier:

```sh
sudo ./flash-all.sh
```

This process should take a few minutes and will print informational messages as 
things progress. Avoid doing anything on the phone while this process is 
operating.

### Lock the Bootloader

If everything was successful, the phone should reboot a few times and finally 
land back on the bootloader screen. At this point, we can re-lock the 
bootloader to enable full verified boot and protect the device from unwanted 
flashing or erasure of data.

```sh
sudo fastboot flashing lock
```

Once done, the device will be wiped and ready for a fresh set-up!
