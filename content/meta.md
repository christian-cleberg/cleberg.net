## Style

### Written

My writing style is a reflection of my true writing style; I always write what I
think and rarely edit anything, aside from minor grammatical errors.

### Visual

I tend to favor minimalistic designs with a heavy emphasis on utility. If
something does not serve a purpose, I likely do not want it on my website. Some
people love this, some hate it. Either way, it's what I prefer.

## Software

I build this website using [Zola](https://getzola.org), which requires the Rust
language. Internally, Zola uses [Tera](https://tera.netlify.app) for templating
and implements written content in [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org).

At the server level, this website runs uses the [Nginx](https://nginx.org) web
server on [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org).

## Hardware

The server running this website is a custom-built, rack-mounted server that you
can [read about here](/blog/server-build/).
