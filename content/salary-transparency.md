## What is This?

This page contains all information about my jobs and salaries for every job I've 
held in my life. I have found a handful of questionable pay discrepancies 
throughout my career and would like to be transparent about my salary data 
online the same way I am in-person with my colleagues.

Note that I have a Bachelor's of Science degree in Accounting from the 
University of Nebraska-Lincoln and have obtained a handful of certifications 
throughout the jobs listed below (e.g., CISA).

While salary can change depending on education, certifications, experience, and 
accomplishments on the job, salaries should not have a stark, surprising 
difference for multiple persons within the same role.
