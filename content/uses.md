The sections below are a moderately updated listing of the various machines and 
software I frequently use.

## Donations

I'm lucky enough to be able to financially support a few open source products 
and communities that are very important to me:

I'm limiting myself to a short software list for brevity - I utilize many more 
programs than the ones listed below.

Note that I currently run Fedora Linux (i3wm) on my laptop, Alpine Linux on my 
servers, and GrapheneOS on my phone.

## Hardware

### Laptop

As of June 2022, I am now using a Lenovo Thinkpad E15 Gen 4 (15") with the 
following configuration:

- Processor: AMD Ryzen™ 5 5625U Processor (2.30 GHz, up to 4.30 GHz Max Boost, 6 
Cores, 12 Threads, 16 MB Cache)
- Graphics: Integrated AMD Radeon™ Graphics
- Memory: 16 GB DDR4 3200MHz (8 GB Soldered + 8 GB DIMM)
- Storage: 512 GB PCIe SSD Gen 4
- Display: 15.6" FHD (1920 x 1080) IPS, anti-glare, 300 nits

For the 1-2 years prior to this, I was using a 2019 Intel-based Macbook Pro 
(16"). Prior to the Macbook, I used a ASUS X751L (17") laptop for 5-ish years.

### Servers

My server rack contains the following hardware:

- UniFi Dream Machine Pro
- UniFi Switch 24 PoE
- Custom Tower PC Server
  - Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-9700 CPU @ 3.00GHz
  - Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Ti
  - Memory: 32 GB DDR4 DIMM
  - Storage: 128 GB SSD, 8TB HDD, 10TB HDD
- Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (8GB RAM)
- Philips Hue Bridge
- Tripp-Lite 12 Socket Surge Protector

I'd love to replace my tower PC with a proper 2U server so that I can also add 
in a patch panel to organize my ethernet cords. However, I'm not sure what specs 
I want in the server and thus, I am hesitant to purchase anything that may not 
be ideal.
